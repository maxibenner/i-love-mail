Hi there!
    
My name is Max. I’m with an organization called Give a Meal. We are currently looking for partners in and around Boston and I thought this could be interesting to you.
      
We are building an online platform that helps both your bottom line as well as people who couldn't afford your products otherwise. We basically enable your customers to purchase additional full priced meals and drinks as donations.

The process is super simple. Receiving a donation takes only a few seconds.

We ran a small test with Livite and Mamaleh's in Brookline and they loved it. Now that the system has proven to work well we are looking to getting more food businesses on board. You can also just sign up at https://www.give-a-meal.org/signup.

If you have any questions or need help getting started, I'd love to set a up a short call.

I’m looking forward to hear from you!

All the Best,
Max
